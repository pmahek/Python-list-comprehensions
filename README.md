# Week 3 – Python List Comprehension Practice

This repository contains practice problems on **Python list comprehensions**, as part of my MSc learning journey.  

The goal of this exercise is to practice writing **concise Python code** for everyday problems, and to build a portfolio of small but meaningful projects.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered
- Basic comprehensions: squares, even numbers, filtering words
- Conditionals: using `if/else` inside comprehensions
- Nested comprehensions: flattening lists, multiplication tables
- Mini problems: string processing, temperature conversion

---

## 🚀 Skills Learned
- Writing shorter and more readable Python code
- Problem-solving using comprehensions
- Structuring Jupyter notebooks for clarity and portfolio use
